## Data Analysis

**[Analyzing Thanksgiving Dinner](https://github.com/BradTombers/Dataquest/blob/master/analyzing_thanksgiving_dinner.ipynb)**
This dataset contains 1058 responses to an online survey about what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location. In my analysis, I show that younger people typically travel farther from home, and the higher your income, the more likely you are to host Thanksgiving.
